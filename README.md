## Amazon EC2 – Compute & Networking Basics

### What I Did
- Launched a Linux EC2 instance using Amazon Linux
- Selected a free-tier eligible instance type
- Configured key pair authentication
- Used default VPC and subnet with a public IP
- Verified instance health (2/2 checks passed)

### What I Learned
- EC2 provides on-demand compute in AWS
- Instances run inside VPCs and subnets
- Security groups act as virtual firewalls
- Public IPs enable internet access
- Instances can be stopped or terminated to manage costs
